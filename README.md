An smartphone app for people having a hard time remembering exercises from physiotherapy.

## Motivation

I had shoulder surgery in mid of March 2021.
I am also a passionate swimmer and want to get my strength, mobility and coordination back as fast as possible.
For that I need to follow advice by my physiotherapist which will give me a number of exercises depending on my current level of progression.
I had a hart time remembering all those exercises.
I also know that the physio session alone will not get me back on track and need to do them myself.
Here we are.
